Appointment Booking System
Description:
This C++ program allows users to book appointments, view existing appointments, and check available time slots. It uses a text file to store appointment data, with each line representing an appointment for a specific time slot (A-M) and the name of the person who has booked that slot.

Features:
Book Appointment: Users can choose an available time slot (A-M) to book an appointment.
View Appointments: Users can view all the appointments and their respective time slots.
Available and Booked Slots: The system shows which slots are available and which ones are already booked.
Files:
appointment.dat: This file is used to store the appointments (e.g., A:John, B:Alice).
appointment.cpp: The main source code file for the appointment system.
Requirements:
A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang) to compile and run the program.
Basic knowledge of C++ and file handling.
How to Use:
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the appointment.cpp file in a C++ IDE or editor.
Compile the code and run the program.
The system will show available time slots for appointments (from 9 AM to 9 PM).
Choose a slot (A-M) to book an appointment or view existing appointments.
If a slot is already booked, the system will inform you and prompt you to select another slot.
